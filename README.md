This C code simulates the execution of a Bit++ program, a simple programming language with only one variable (`x`) and two operations (`++` and `--`). 

1. It reads an integer `n` representing the number of statements in the Bit++ program.
2. For each statement, it reads the operation and updates the value of `x` accordingly.
3. If the operation is `++`, it increments the value of `x` by 1. If the operation is `--`, it decrements the value of `x` by 1.
4. After executing all the statements, it prints the final value of `x`.

This code effectively interprets the Bit++ program and determines the final value of the variable `x` after executing the program.
